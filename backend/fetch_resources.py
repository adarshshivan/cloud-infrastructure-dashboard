fetch_resources.py
-------------------
📘 Description:
This file is a placeholder to represent where backend logic would normally exist
to fetch real-time AWS resource data (EC2 instances, S3 buckets, etc.).

In this Vercel-deployed version, the dashboard uses a static JSON file located in:
    frontend/data/real_dashboard_data.json

For the actual AWS data fetching implementation,
please refer to the backend repository:
👉 https://github.com/adarshshivan/cloud-infrastructure-dashboard-backend

That repository contains the Python code (main.py) which connects to AWS using
boto3, extracts resource information, and exports it as JSON to be used by this
dashboard.
